ü´Ä ECG Signal Classification with ML Models
This project demonstrates how to classify ECG (electrocardiogram) signals using machine learning models. It utilizes the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset, which contains thousands of heartbeat samples. The pipeline includes signal visualization, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation using multiple metrics including ROC curves.

üì¶ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is downloaded via KaggleHub and includes:

mitbih_train.csv

mitbih_test.csv

Each row in the dataset represents a heartbeat signal (187 data points) followed by a label (class).

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
Download and Load Dataset
Uses kagglehub to download and load ECG signals into pandas DataFrames.

Data Visualization
Plots a sample ECG signal and detects R-peaks using scipy.signal.find_peaks.

Feature Extraction
For each signal, 4 key features are extracted:

Root Mean Square (RMS)

Mean

Standard Deviation

Number of R-peaks

Preprocessing

The feature matrix is scaled using StandardScaler.

Labels are binarized for multi-class ROC analysis.

Model Training and Evaluation
Trains and evaluates the following models:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

For each model:

Accuracy and classification report are printed.

Confusion matrix is visualized with seaborn heatmaps.

ROC curves are plotted for each class (if supported by the model).

üìä Output
Confusion matrices for all models

ROC curves per class

Performance comparison across five classifiers
